# NOTE: passff extension is using sed/curl during install and python/pass to run
# Make sure those dependencies are installed on the target system before enabling this part.
# It doesn't make a lot of sense to have all these dependencies added to the firefox role, just for using
# this extension, which isn't enabled by default.
# Personally I find it has better UI/UX than browserpass, but browserpass is more lightweight.
